# Todo List Application

This repository contains a simple Todo list web application built with the following stack:

- **Backend:** [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) (Python) with SQLite database
- **Frontend:** [React](https://react.dev/) served as static files

## Project Structure

```
backend/       # FastAPI application
  main.py      # API endpoints and SQLite setup
  requirements.txt
frontend/      # Minimal React frontâ€‘end
  index.html
  index.js
README.md      # Project documentation
LICENSE
```

## Development

1. Create a virtual environment and install backend dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

2. Run the API server:

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

3. Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser to use the React interface.

## Database

SQLite is used as the database engine. A file named `todo.db` will be created automatically when the server starts.
